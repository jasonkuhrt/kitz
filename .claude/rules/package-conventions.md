# Package Conventions

When starting work on a package, check if it has conventions:

```
packages/<package-name>/.claude/CONVENTIONS.md
```

If the file exists, read it to load package-specific rules into context before implementing.

Package conventions supplement project-wide conventions - they don't replace them.
